{"name":"Webui-aria2中文版","tagline":"这是一个aria2的控制端,你可以在任何html5浏览器中使用.","body":"webui-aria2\r\n===========\r\n汉化版地址：http://aria2.ghostry.cn/webui-aria2-master/\r\n\r\n![Main interface](/screenshots/overview.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe aim for this project is to create the worlds best and hottest interface to interact with aria2. aria2 is the worlds best file downloader, but sometimes the command line brings more power than necessary. The project was initially created as part of the GSOC scheme, however it has rapidly grown and changed with tremendous support and feedback from the aria2 community.\r\n\r\nVery simple to use, no build scripts, no installation scripts. First start aria2 in the background either in your local machine or in a remote one. You can do that as follows:\r\n````bash\r\naria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-listen-all\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\nIf aria2 is not installed in your local machine then head on to http://aria2.sourceforge.net/ and follow the instructions there.\r\n\r\nThen download the webui, you can either do that by downloading this repository and running index.html in the browser. Or you could just head on to http://ziahamza.github.io/webui-aria2/ and just start downloading files! After that you can also save it for offline use by saving from the browser save page as option.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n====\r\n1. You can always select which files to download in case of torrents or metalinks. Just pause a download and a list icon should appear next to the settings button. To select which files to download before starting the download, give the flag --pause-metadata to aria2. See [link](http://aria2.sourceforge.net/manual/en/html/aria2c.html#cmdoption--pause-metadata)\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\nRead and edit [configuration.js](configuration.js).\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\nWell, you need aria2. And a web browser (if that even counts!)\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n=======\r\nFor any support, feature request and bug report add an issue in the github project. [link](https://github.com/ziahamza/webui-aria2/issues)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nRefer to the LICENSE file (MIT License). If the more liberal license is needed then add it as an issue\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
